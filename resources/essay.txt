The Actual Essay


# Celebrating Black History Month as a Writer (Not a "Reader")

February is Black History Month in the United States, where it originated. Black History month, as of 2018, however, is an international celebration. Aside from the United States, it is celebrated annually in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Netherlands. We don't officially celebrate it in Ghana, but even if as a dual citizen of both the USA and Ghana, I can claim the right to celebrate the American version, as a part of my inheritance, I feel one is free to join in, regardless of country or ethnicity. Black History month, in the words of Gerald Ford, who extended it from its original "Black History Week" to a "Black History Month", this celebration of black people is designed to "seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history." 

Despite this official version, I think we needn't restrict the black people we celebrate as Americans, and even the matter of "history" is a technicality we can overlook. It's seems to be more about creating a mood to the entire month of February, where one finds company, nationally and worldwide, (particularly so this year, thanks to the smash-hit movie "Black Panther") in enjoying and celebrating any aspect of black culture. I rarely watch movies these days, but my black history month celebrations, which started even before February, consisted in the building up and the breaking down (and the procrastinating) of this piece I've put together. It was a near thing to not finish it, but I hope now it's out, it's an interesting point of view. It's from a black person, who once thought all the thinking work about being black was finalized on being born black. Thanks to his skin color, he was all innocence, as far as having a need to think about all that sort of stuff, or so he imagined. The writing of this piece is me attempting to undo years of stationary inertia, and hopefully inaugurating a course of active work in this regard, which I've realized there's plenty of room for.


I was born in the USA, which is how I'm a citizen of that country, but I grew up in the Middle East for most of my childhood. Kids in school were just silly. Nothing they called me about my color stung at all. Then, when I was 9, we relocated to Ghana, and then, all of a sudden, the names that actually hurt started flying when I was at school. But I could shrug off school once I was through the doors at home, and rode out junior high school and high school on a river of books I liked (some were school books) and computer games. Time flew past. Finished high school, left Ghana to attend university in the States, and spent the first serious amount of time there in my life. After graduation, I stayed, and worked a good number of years over there as a coder, and then returned to Ghana 4 years ago. Back for good, we'll see... As an adult, I really do like it here, though. Over the course of these four years, I've had the time andthe distance to be ab;e to look back on the decade I spent in the States, and I have since come to realizations that would have been too charged, but yet too pointless, to be things I'd have allowed myself arrive at, living in the US. Many of these thoughts relate to how much being of a different race from the majority matters, in contrast to how life is in Ghana.


## What's it Like Being Black? Nothing Really...

Back home in Ghana now, I was recently explaining to a white friend what being a black man is all about, because at the time, it seemed an important idea to share. What's it like, being a black man? 

Well, being a black man is like... nothing, really. It's the life of an ordinary man, trying to get things done, make things happen...

So I'd like to pause here, and explain this point a little further. About how ordinary the "black" experience is. I can only speak for myself, but you can't tell me it's *not* the "black experience", if I do indeed have black skin. I like abstractions, and as proof that a lot of the life we're living is just the same, I had the idea of a thought experiment.


## The "Mirror" Test

Just how ordinary do I think I am? I had a realization in front of a mirror, and I thought I'd use it to describe what a very basic experience is like for me - what happens when I cross in front of a mirror, or a bit of reflective glass. 

Well, much like you, I'm going to guess, when I cross in front of it I expect to see... nothing. Just more scenery moving past, and the parallax effect. I wasn't planning on being interrupted. Now instead, this all-of-a-sudden, new, but decidedly "safe" person, existing at what would be an unsafe distance, were he someone else. 

[img]

I'm sure there are many like me who would prefer it were we totally transparent; just a sky crossing through the empty space of the vaster one above, making powdery soft sounds of thought, as one moves about, thinking... 


But in front of shiny surface, one is denied these dreams over and over. From behind reflective surfaces everywhere, the same person just as always looks forward at us. "Oh, there he goes again. Same face. Same nose, same eyes. Sure." As if all our ideas simply aren't being creative enough for a real difference once day... But hold the phone, what do we have now? One day, we look and check, and it's like everything has gone wrong. "Crow's feet? Gray hairs? Acne? When did that happen?!"

Well within the vast confines of dark-skin-complexion territory, I feel there are so many fascinating revisions to make on what I feel trapped to be working with every day, that the color started with is hardly remembered. To look over my face in the mirror, and be able to take in a totally new epiphany that I'm a black person is a magic trick I just can't work, actually. I can shoo myself in the direction of those thoughts, but my heart wouldn't be in the result; the heart is too busy elsewhere, whining about other news reports from the mirror. 

I was hoping to stay abstract, and I already feel hopelessly vain, and slightly ashamed. However, if any of this sounds similar, I trust my reader may empathize with what it's like to try and push away the mirror as a lie about what we are, whatever our skin complexion may be. Good luck to us all in that regard, honestly...


## What's it Like Being Black? Nothing Really, Except When It Isn't "Nothing".

So I'll sort of backtrack at this point, and restate and finish what I said above...

Being a black man is like. It's like... nothing, really. It's the life of an ordinary man, trying to get things done, living his life out in society, and trying to make his dreams happen... However, he finds himself mysteriously thwarted in way others don't seem to be, the helpless conclusion is forced to arrive at, is that something about having dark-brown skin matter. Before that had nothing to do about life; now he's black. Even if illusory.

This first moment of confusion begins as a child. Having recently learned colors, and someone explains to you that you're black. You may argue back, but he or she (in my case, my mum) explains, "Black actually means brown, when we talk about people." A minor wtf, but whatever, kids learn vocabulary and other rules quickly. A confused child flashes "black" for a second, but that fades away, and he goes back to being an ordinary, normal kid.

Life continues, and a concept you never came up with on your own starts to affect your life (e.g. who to sit with and not to sit with in school) and it seems there are more hidden rules to this thing, which no one explains to you quite as clearly as they did the first time.

Suppose something unpleasant that really confuses you happens, and you go away to figure out what happened in private. The last thing any human male wants to do, having pride, is make up a a story as silly-sounding as his skin color, as to why he has failed in this or that personal goal, or was slow to succeed. Nobody can read minds. In those sly cases, the absolute worst ones, how sure can anyone be that skin color had anything to do with what did or didn't happen? 

All things considered, as I see it there is no "tangible" benefit I get from having dark skin. I mean, assume I was moving down an empty corridor - what good or harm is any of that to me? If I were a hermit in the wild, or - actually pretty close these days - a hermit programmer, coding "the start-up" in privacy - it doesn't affect my situation. So then, if being black is essentially nothing to me, how did it become anything to you?

It's difficult reason your way to the conclusion that you've been racially discriminated against. Your arugments have to work not just for yourself, but also be effective for others too. When one is eventually able to, years might have past. Take for example, something that happened to me a while back. Walking back to a subway station with a friend in NY, after a dinner once, I commented that a friend of his that I had just been introduced to at dinner was rather interesting. His smiling reply was, "I think she's into [let's just say] Persian men." She's also white, as well. In my head, I was like, "Whoa! Hold up just a second, there. That's not exactly where I was going with that, but wait. As somebody she's never ever met before, I'm not new enough an idea to make any of that not matter?!" That was how I saw it, and because I wasn't about to start trying to explain to my friend who'd known me years how cool I still was, or something, I said nothing of note to that. I let him drive on, and we carried the conversation onwards.

Maybe to you it seems obviously careless, or possibly incredible, of him to say something like that to me, but he's a really nice guy, only a little self-centered, haha. (If you're reading this, no offense, bud...)  But at the time he said this to me in New York those years ago, it never crossed my mind at all that my skin color had anything to do it. Living as a disembodied head floating over the streets of New York, I simply thought Hassan Abudu was being accused of being lame. For everyone, isn't that the more important line to not cross? Not be called lame? It took years to realize that this perfectly-nice friend of mine, with whom I was once pretty close, was being, well, racist to say such a thing. Were I white, just like the two of them, could he have said something like that to me? He knew where I was from, so could he have ever have said something like, "She's into Haitian men," to me? Now that it's been many years since that night, and with so many other things I'd honestly say would be more important for us to talk about, I don't know when or how I'd ever raise this ancient history for direct conversation with my old friend.


## The Meritocracy

Beyond anything else that unites us, I believe in humanity's respect and belief in the meritocracy. Beyond anything else, it is meritocracy that has pulled us out of skepticism in our dark-ages caves, and out into the sunshine and the glittering, reflective-glass skylines of modern times. In the same way, demonstrable proof of claims have won out over skepticism, I believe it is what I can do, and not what I appear to be, that will matter most. I will work on my character, and after I too have been of demonstrable benefit to those around me, karma comes back around full-circle, and will make me whole, if things feel partial for now.

  Dr. King said, "I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."

He already said it, and haven't they been since saying that it worked, or something?

Recently, I watched an interview by Ayn Rand on YouTube. And in it, she was saying,

  Interviewer: And then, if a man is weak, or a woman is weak, then she is beyond, then he is beyond love?

  Ayn Rand: He certainly does not deserve it. He certainly isn't beyond! He can always correct. Man has free will. If man wants love, he should correct his weaknesses or his flaws, and he may deserve it. He cannot expect the unearned. Neither in love, nor in money. Neither in matter, or in spirit.

To not expect the unearned, matter or spirit - 100% agreed with you, Ms. Rand. I have been and continue to work on myself, and to all the haters and slow-to-arrive dough stacks, I hope to deserve something better from you all one day. Let's both have patience. :D

All throughout my decade of living in America, surely enough, I have faced discrimination in ways trivial and important to me. All the while, though, I was just assuming it was a miscalculation on their part. (A "Bayesian" miscalculation, heh, for all wannabe ML-engineers in the house, like myself). You figured my being black means I could be something you think you're familiar with from prior experiences - you could even be black yourself. However, I'm actually African, and I spent all of my childhood, and most of my life, outside the United States. If I don't explain myself and my background to you, what could you possibly get right by guessing? 

So in this way, while living in the States, I reduced any overt racial discrimination I experienced to a matter of not knowing enough. Something about "t"s of my slightly British-sounding accent might hit you as funny, and from your own questions, I'd happily explain my background to you. In this quiet way, by waiting for questions to naturally come up, I felt like I was changing the minds of the people around me, and I was only sorry about those who couldn't be helped by greater information. I never directly talked "black politics" directly, never felt a need to.

That all changed. I wish that was good enough, but I realized it wasn't. The wheel of change and progress won't pivot on the axle of that kind of logic alone.



## Black History Month 2017


I'm a little late the party, but the theme of  year's theme was, "the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans". Since the history of African Americans isn't over yet - we're it, tomorrow - we can ask, what's the deal with education in the present, and how does that affect the lives of African Americans today? So that we can look back on a year like last year's from this one, or this year, from one of the next, and explain how that defines the lives of African Americans?

I went to a great school for college, and thank you so very much Stanford University, I really appreciated the experience. Not even from Ghana, and heck, not even from my high-school class that year was I the only black person admitted, and according to the stats, a total of 671 were. Never felt lonely that way. Shout out to Ujamaa, the black culture dorm at Stanford, where I used hang out. A shout out to the excellent people and black friends I made during my time there. Friends like Jidenna and Issa Rae, who later on became very successful in their careers, but then these are just two of so many others I continue to hear about via Facebook friend feed, also doing amazing things. Being doctors, software engineers, computer science professors, tech entrepreneurs, whatever you like. If the idea was to make it a matter of no consequence if you were white or black, if you wanted to turn up wherever you wanted, you could are several reasons why a world-class education is importnat with. And it's great that there are world-class instutituions around, who warmly welcome and thoughtfully consider the minority student body, like Stanford does. They're doing well at this, and keep doing better each year. The percentage of black students and other minorities in the student body is on an upward trajectory, year after year...

However. I thought something new about this recently.

As of 2016 (https://diversityandaccess.stanford.edu/diversity/diversity-facts), black undergrads at Stanford made up 3.8% of the student body. In comparison, in 2016, we made up 13.3% of the US population (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216). Supposing we were at parity one day, that if black people make up 13.3% US, we were also roughly 13.3% of the Stanford student body. Would this be good enough? 

Before I wouldn't have had a strong opinion. "Sure, why not?" But now, thinking these things over, particularly since my return to Ghana, I now feel certain of how I'd respond.

My reply? 

Hello no!


## African-American Education: Trying Science Experiments

 Allow me to quote something a professor emeritus of physics wrote in response to a question posted online.  Not to force the estimable Prof. Muller into this particular conversation about race, and what he was writing about had nothing whatsoever to do with race, but since he shared this all publicly, I think it's fair game to quote him, and then discuss something. He wrote, in a response to a Quora question "What Did You Do As a Child That You Hid From Your Parents",

    "Once, at a physics department meeting I asked the other professors, 'How many of you made gunpowder when you were a kid.' About ⅔ raised their hands." (https://www.quora.com/What-did-you-do-as-a-child-that-you-hid-from-your-parents/answer/Richard-Muller-3?share=b6b4448d&srid=p2QH)

Something about this sounded... funny. Or, rather, invited me to ignore it, and that's when I start sounding the alarm. Later on I discovered what it was, and it was great. Glad I did.

Please pardon me, Prof. Muller and Berkeley Physics Department, but I'm going to bet (without doing further research (which I imagine is actually possible with the Internet) there was nary a black physics professor in the room, and if there was, I think that professor was definitely a part of the 1/3. I stand to be corrected, and be brought up to date. But I was a science student, and I laugh to imagine what Dr. and Mrs. Abudu would have done, if I did anything so wonderful in my childhood as making gunpowder.

[todo: chapelle gif ]

If you aren't black and you don't believe me, I can't quite put into words funny enough how needless it'd be to ask successful black friends of yours, from any walk of life, whether any of them did something quite so marvelous as children either. But just take it from me. No need.


Strict or forgiving parents are one thing, but society is a whole nother. In many  matters, the pressure black parents respond to will be societal pressure, which will add to their own personal sensibilities, conservative and liberal, and sway them hard in matters like this. It's just altogether too extraordinary for a black kid to be caught trying something like this, and in the case of young Prof. Muller, have the police end up coming by. If things go wrong, a the homework a black parent now has of explaining how they raise their children seems far greater, than a white parent, even if they're defensive of experimentation in general. The attitude we have, definitely in Africa, is to encourage kids in their studies by saying, "Go and read your books!", not, "Go and do your science experiments!" If all it takes to be a good student is to faithfully be able to replicate the content of your textbooks, it would seem like there's no need to bother with riskier approaches of any kind. If a kid insists on "risky experiments", this is perhaps evidence of their being distracted, or possibly even wayward.


But to break ground any academic field, and truly become exceptional, you have to do original work. Originality is costly. Not all experiments go right, there is a cost to getting it wrong, and if we're going to want "move fast and break things" for a little while, regardless if we're building a start-up or something different, let's ask this. Supposing society wanted to invest in black education, and eventually some black success stories, in this way. If part of the secret cost of having more black physics professors in Berkeley is something like having a lot more patience when black children make experiments, can we be patient with this? Can we say that for at least two decades, we all wait patiently for the experiments to run their course, until a possible a cohort of gunpowder-making or perhaps virus-writing black kids dust themselves off, and join the ranks of Berkeley faculty?

If there's a pathway to a lot of original thinking, it is an invisible maze, lined by a electrified fences. It wards off black kids from thinking in a lot of new directions, long before they've a plan, and get to work on trying a earnestly well-intentioned but risky science experiment...


Even though I'm not a scientist - at best a software engineer - I'm well-acquainted with risk and controversy, particularly concerning the arts. And from being just a "writer", I'll explain the journey to becoming a "black writer", because writing while remembering and forgetting that you're "black" is an altogether different activity than just "writing". I used to ignore it, but I'm hoping henceforth to rise to this challenge, begining with very my first article on Medium.com.



## African-American Education: Writing While Black


I wrote a fairly well-known writer I'm friends with, recently. The topic was writing education, and I was saying,


        "It seems to me that anything that I wish were in words is an opportunity, then duty concerning practice. Like, "How nice if somehow this mental gas were somehow words [...]" I then assume I have work to do, and (all too often) a reader's patience to try... But I really hope you all forgive me one day - I really think it's worth it. Increasingly, not just for this original idea of Hassan as a flexible thinker [ed: pardon any hubris], but as a representative of a black/African/Ghanaian man's life lived candidly, in a "post-racial" world where that's seemingly besides the point...  (I wish writing that didn't seem rude, or antagonistic, but just true.)"


For a sense of my writing journey, a literature teacher I had in high school was fundamental to making me interest in literature. If writing didn't "work", like a programming language manual just "works", then before having Mr. Jehu-Appiah as my teacher, it was a waste of a better opportunity to spend time. A year or so after reading literary fiction, I wrote something that wasn't homework for the first time. I wanted to put my thoughts down in a diary, because that was the best way to give a social disaster I went through in high school the same sort of remove and dignity I found in the literary fiction I'd been enjoying. Later on, disaster forgotten, I was on the Nobel Prize website, looking over the Nobel diplomas, I decided that out of all the Nobel Prizes to be had, I'd go for Literature. They had the coolest Nobel Diplomas. Now, some 15 years later, unpublished, it's interesting. To be honest, writing code professionally may be nearly enough literary self-expression for my whole life. This isn't forced enthusiasm, and perhaps I'll explain why so later in another article. I still like to write, maybe one day I'll be published, maybe not, but as far as Nobel Prizes go, drawing my own art to my writing seems to have cured me of my burning desire for Nobel Diplomas. I don't think I could be happier, but Swedish Academy, you're always welcome to try, heh.

Later on, in my twenties, when I was deliberately practicing the craft of writing daily - and spinning my gears, I'll tell you - I ran quite often enough into a problem I think all Black writers of fiction run into, in some way. All crafts are refined through the practice of copying the works of a master. As far as the English literary canon goes, given how few black writers exist in it, it's a bit "interesting" to me if you're Black and you just happen to find yourself surrounded by Black writers as all, or even most, of your major literary influences. When I say literary influences, I refer to purely their writing techniques, not that their serve as an inspiration to you... If you say that's you, and can pass a double-blind test to verify your sincerity - you can pass the "Black writer" Turing test - I mean, damn, that's actually kind of cool. Me personally, I didn't luck out that way. Some of my favorite writers include Tolstoy, J. D. Salinger, Helen DeWitt, and David Mitchell, and they've all influenced my style. If I sit down to study one of these writers, by attempting to re-create an existing story of theirs in my own way? Well, this is nobody's fault here, but it's just what is it that the characters in their stories are very rarely black. Then, if I'm breaking out all on my own to write an original story, because it seemed harder to explain why black characters "suited" my story, my characters don't really get colors. It's much like how characters in stories don't get bathroom breaks.

I ended up not writing much fiction of my own all, all those years, and nearly all of it consisted of colorless people, come to think of it. To bring us to the present day, and finish the story of my writing journey, most of my writing teeth were cut in writing correspondence to people, and private journaling. I don't find that a bad way to go, actually. At some point, luck had be being called a writer, or "a storyteller" by my friends (thank you all kindly!), but how did I transition to being a "black writer" instead of just a "writer"? 

Well, this happened when I started facing that "casting problem" all over again, when I started making visual art. I never really took time aside to confronted the issue of casting black people in my art when it came to writing, but this issue is much harder to avoid when you're drawing. Like earlier claimed, to level up in art, you study and copy the works of masters, and to do so, I found myself populating the world of my private portfolio with essentially zero black people. This felt troubling. I mean, imagine a 6-foot tall black dude huddling over a paper, and drawing white people. Over and over again, as if he's sad. There's nothing wrong with that, in case he was, only there seems something a little fishy to me, if you're saying that person is Hassan. Then, mirrored surfaces everywhere stamp my eyes with the image of a black man everywhere I go. On every mirrored surface, I make this instant art piece. Now on paper, it's like I always have a different idea - is this bothering me somehow? Supposing someone claims it is bothering me, and then mutes me on the TV he's watching me from when I start to argue back. Then they continue looking on at me, with an evil smile. Is the only thing I can do complain it's an unfair fight? Can't I take pencil and paper, and draw something else instead? Fight back with a pencile, and take that grin off their face?


I see this black man being littered in mirrors everywhere, like a quick, but very accurate graffiti tag. If as an artist, I'm supposed to be able to reply with an artistic reaction to anything I see around me, why don't I make art of this fellow, art out of this art? Supposing out of "modesty", I want to specifically avoid him - perhaps he's "complicated", for now - then what about the people who look kind of similar? Now, as depiction in visual art, their lips are sealed, unlike how the situation was in literature. This indeed simplifies a whole lot. Yet I'm still saying I find art like this too hard?


This riddle of continuity, connecting 2D hieroglyphs, starting from "the artist who refuses to draw himself" and going outwards the others of similar color, all the way out to white people. The ultimate human mystery. This artist now puts his pencil down, to do his part, in order to start shading in the outlines, and he starts on the far end away from himself, and stays there. Pfff!

 #todo: art

Since confronting this casting issue, with regards to visual art, the situation has vastly improved.

I learned something here, but it's a lesson for all of us, I think. I realized that avoiding a conversation can be done as easily as choosing to not engage it. "Economizing effort". "Exercising lawful preferences" - all our due, right? Time for me to disagree. Sometimes, you have to "do something" in order to be said to be "not do something"! In this case, to not "avoid a conversation" about race, I have to engage it. How funny!

I never wrote about a black character specifically, but for the first time I am. The first black character I've written into a story is myself. And from here on forwards, I aim to openly engage, in writing, any aspect of my life or thoughts that my racial identity has a bearing on. The topic of racial identity needn't be forced, but I think it should come up as naturally as it just does, and I know I've been avoiding it. But no more. From here on forwards, I will not be purposefully avoiding the topic of my being black! In writing! Or in person! Oh, and let the crickets chirp after I do! I shall do so anyway! Oh, I shall! Oh, I shall! 

Yes, I can already feel a wind blowing. All those many years of letters, so many letters, personal letter, so many of which I had to dig deep and scrape my soul for, but I somehow missed talking about how the extra complication of being black added to my confusion every single time I reached in?! It not something that easy to talk about, but the missed opportunity was that I never even thought to try and perhaps U-turn backwards, even when I knew it mattered. Most often it doesn't actually matter at all, but sometimes, it really just does. My principle, going forwards, is that if I thought about it, then I won't avoid it. If I didn't think it, then as per the usual, no need to mention anything.


As a writer, I believe it's important to write with total honesty, and opening up to write about the "black experience" could be seen as just another opportunity for further improvement, as an honest writer in the making. But like I was saying earlier to my writer friend. I worry that talking about my blackness is a subset of talking about politics, which like religion, is a overly-personal topic to address, and best avoided if you were speaking especially without educational expertise. That was always my thing - I couldn't write or talk about black issues, because I wasn't studied enough on the topic to sound credible.


I don't in even if one doesn't intentionally include I think it's important helpful for all of us, if more writers became "black writers".

## Writing While Black: Why Bother

We, living today, are all the opportunities the future has as a starting place, and why can't the future have whatever selection in nearly any quantity of black writers that it wants? Someone in the future just wants to see the writing of a thirty-something year old Ghanaian writer, writing online in 2018? Here you go; whatever you needed it for, I hope it helped... But how about my fellow Ghanaians? Let's open up the age range, and now, can we add up to over 50 writers writing on Medium.com this year? And at least a dozen articles from each of us.

Whoever you may be, I don't think there are enough "yous" to go around. If you haven't published anything here yet, and chances are, you haven't, your thoughts on a page are a priceless rarity - please write and publish something soon, and bring the price down. But since February is Black History Month in the us, I thought I might suggest why it's particularly important, we black folks in particular should write.

It's parallel to the  argument I make about feminism, even if you feel that's too girly for you. Just a short walk. According to [this](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk) women made up nearly 51% of the US population in 2016. At 51%, you're the majority, and not the minority. However, as just one example of a sort of job both men and women can do, 7 percent of the directors of the top 250 films of 2016 were female directors (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/women-filmmakers-2016-statistics-show-female-directors-declined-number-963729). 

As I understand it, provided you like movies, you have all the required to be able to enjoy the filmmaking process, and to even become very good at it one day. And the desire to tell stories, but this time with a budget to spend, is something that I think appeals equally to the sexes. So is there's a invisible net, somehow fishing women out of the pool of opportunity to direct top movies? 51% down to 7% is pretty steep. Never mind feminism; fair play is an issue that affects us all. How sure are you that you're not being fished out by invisible nets wherever you are too? If 51% percent of the US can barely break into the US film industry as directors, what sort of chances do I have breaking through as a member of a 13%-of-the-US-population minority? Fuzzy feelings aside, I'd feel a whole lot more relieved about how the world if the numbers we are parity. Chances are, part of why I don't feel relieved about the way the world works, and that the world actively stresses us all, is because these numbers don't. It just makes sense that women should be the first to see some of the progress, as things start to get better.

In the same way, Black people in the US have fought one of the longest, most arduous, colorful and disgraceful battles for cultural acceptance in the United States. And we're still not yet at parity, still not seen as entirely "normal". Education was a huge part of getting us there, but as I see it, it's still too rare to find black writers, both on print and on the Internet. It's altogether too much of a pleasant surprise to find a black writer writing on the Internet, and since it's free to write on places like Medium.com, I think part of why we aren't writing is because, just like making homemade explosives in order to learn about the natural universe, putting yourself out there as a writer without a similar-seeming writers that contextualize your efforts seems unnecessarily risky way to learn about yourself and explore your world.

Well, I quote a poem from Nayirrah Waheed,

    when i am afraid to speak
    is when i speak.
    that is when it is most important

    - the freedom in fear"

Terror struck at least 5 times while writing this essay, so I hope I pulled through, and successfully followed her advice. 

So I guess this whole of this essay is just to say what I wanted to say, but never did, for the first time, to correspondents old and new. Hi everyone! I'm Hassan, I'm taking the plunge to be a black writer, writing about black writing. Happy last day of Black History Month 2018! Writing is important.
